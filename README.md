# Logomap

Angular app created as a part of my master's thesis with Supabase and Leaflet for Angular.

It has a button for parsing the csv file from https://github.com/agunje123/logoscrape-diplomski and uploading it to the Supabase database.
There's a table and a Leaflet map for displaying the parsed data. Clicking on a table row pans to the selected SLP practice in the Leaflet map.
